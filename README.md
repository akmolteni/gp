The GP project was initiated to address the need for a platform to record and track infrequent thoughts over an extended period. Traditional weblogs proved to be unsuitable due to their emphasis on frequent updates, while memoirs were too lengthy and comprehensive for this purpose. The solution was to create a lightweight, portable application using Jekyll. This approach ensures that the platform is easy to manage, deploy, and can be carried across different environments seamlessly. The GP project serves as an ideal tool for capturing and reflecting on sporadic thoughts and insights efficiently.
